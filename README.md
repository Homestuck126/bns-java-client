# ITM BNS Java Client SDK User Guide English Version

[中文版](./README_ZH.md)

## Introduction

This is ITM BNS Java Client User Guide. The User Guide will guide you through several documents to help you develop and integrate our SDK . Before starting the user guide, we highly recommend that you complete the [Architecture of BNS Client and BNS Server](https://github.com/itrustmachines/itm-spo-sdk-doc).

## Getting Started

### Quick Starts

The quickstarts are intended to guide you through the steps to install packages required to SDK, configure the settings for sample code, and check the ledgerinput result.

- [About quickstarts](itm-bns-sample/doc/quick_start_en.md)
- [Download the SDK](itm-bns-sample/doc/quick_start_en.md#1-download-the-sdk)
- [Install packages required to SDK](itm-bns-sample/doc/quick_start_en.md#2-install-packages-required-to-sdk)
- [Configure setting for the Sample Code](itm-bns-sample/doc/quick_start_en.md#3-configure-the-settings-for-sample-code)
- [Run the Sample code](itm-bns-sample/doc/quick_start_en.md#4-run-the-sample-code)
- [Check the result](itm-bns-sample/doc/quick_start_en.md#5-check-the-result)

Complete the quickstarts for each step, then you will be ready to run the tutorial and develop our BNS Java Client with your own applications.

### Tutorials

The tutorials are intended to guide you through following documents to build the CMD, Callback, ReceiptDao and other BNS Java Client settings.

- [Build the CMD](itm-bns-sample/doc/cmd_en.md)
- [Build the Callback Applications](itm-bns-sample/doc/callback_en.md)
- [Build the ReceiptDao Applications](itm-bns-sample/doc/receiptDao_en.md)
- [Configure setting of BNS Java Client](itm-bns-sample/doc/other_setting_en.md)

Complete the previous tutorials document, then you can choose to read the **Auto folder attestation**. Unlike the CMD attestation, the auto folder attestation can scan the entire folder and automatically attest each file in the folder

- [Auto folder attestation](bns-auto-folder-attest/doc/bns-auto-folder-attest_en.md)

Complete the tutorial for each document, then you will be ready to run the [Summary of BNS Java Client](itm-bns-sample/doc/summary_en.md) to learn more about our BNS SDK
